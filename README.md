## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trishpurkait/plant-disease-detection-system.git
cd plant-disease-detection-system
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up your Gemini API key**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or directly in `app.py`:
```python
genai.configure(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

5. **Create required directories**
```bash
mkdir -p static/uploads
mkdir -p model
```

6. **Add your trained model**

Place your trained model file in the `model/` directory:
```
model/best_model_resume.keras
```

## 🏃 Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Open your browser**

Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

3. **Upload a plant image**
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop an image
   - Click "Analyze Plant" 🔍
   - View results with AI-powered treatment recommendations! 💊

## 📦 Dependencies

```txt
Flask==3.0.0
tensorflow==2.15.0
numpy==1.24.3
Werkzeug==3.0.1
google-generativeai==0.3.2
Pillow==10.1.0
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration
Edit `app.py` to update model settings:
```python
IMG_SIZE = 256  # Image input size
class_names = [...]  # Update based on your model classes
```

### Gemini API Configuration
Adjust AI model settings:
```python
model_gemini = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-2.5-flash')
```

Available models:
- `models/gemini-2.5-flash` - Fast and efficient (recommended)
- `models/gemini-2.5-pro` - More powerful, slower

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads a plant leaf image (JPG, PNG, JPEG)
2. **Preprocessing**: Image is resized to 256x256 and normalized (scaled to 0-1)
3. **Disease Detection**: CNN model predicts disease class with confidence score
4. **AI Analysis**: If disease detected, Gemini AI generates:
   - Quick summary (2-5 critical actions)
   - Detailed treatment plan (expandable)
5. **Display Results**: 
   - Plant type and disease/status
   - Confidence percentage with visual bar
   - Formatted treatment recommendations with proper styling

## 🧪 Model Training Details

The CNN model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset with:
- **20,600+ images** across 15 classes
- **Image augmentation** for better generalization
- **Transfer learning** techniques
- **Final accuracy: 95.86%**
